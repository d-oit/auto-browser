It is best known for its consumer electronics, software, and services. Founded in 1976 as Apple Computer Company by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne, the company was incorporated by Jobs and Wozniak as Apple Computer, Inc. the following year. It was renamed Apple Inc. in 2007 as the company had expanded its focus from computers to consumer electronics. Apple is the largest technology company by revenue, with US$391.04 billion in the 2024 fiscal year.\nThe company was founded to produce and market Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. Its second computer, the Apple II, became a best seller as one of the first mass-produced microcomputers. Apple introduced the Lisa in 1983 and the Macintosh in 1984, as some of the first computers to use a graphical user interface and a mouse. By 1985, internal company problems led to Jobs leaving to form NeXT, Inc., and Wozniak withdrawing to other ventures; John Sculley served as long-time CEO for over a decade.WikipediaCEOTim CookTim CookFoundedApr 1, 1976HeadquartersCupertino, CaliforniaUnited StatesWebsiteapple.comEmployees164,000\n", error=None, include_in_memory=False), ActionResult(is_done=True, extracted_content='{"stock_price": "$222.83", "price_change": "-$0.83", "company_name": "Apple Inc", "market_cap": "3.36T USD", "volume": "51.42M", "news_items": ["As Apple Earnings Near, More Investors Think the iPhone Maker‚Äôs Stock Is Primed to Fall", "Is Apple Stock a Buy Before Q1 Earnings?", "Apple\'s Earnings Strength Keeps BofA Bullish Despite iPhone Concerns", "Nvidia overtakes Apple by market value"], "search_input": ""}', error=None, include_in_memory=False)], all_model_outputs=[{'go_to_url': {'url': 'https://www.google.com/finance'}}, {'scroll_down': {'amount': 300}}, {'scroll_down': {'amount': 300}}, {'extract_content': {'include_links': False}}, {'scroll_to_text': {'text': 'AAPL'}}, {'scroll_to_text': {'text': 'Apple Inc'}}, {'scroll_to_text': {'text': '$222.83'}}, {'scroll_to_text': {'text': '-$0.83'}}, {'scroll_to_text': {'text': 'MARKET_CAP'}}, {'scroll_to_text': {'text': 'VOLUME'}}, {'scroll_to_text': {'text': "Today's financial news"}}, {'click_element': {'index': 3}}, {'scroll_to_text': {'text': '$222.80'}}, {'scroll_to_text': {'text': '-$0.86'}}, {'scroll_to_text': {'text': 'MARKET_CAP'}}, {'scroll_to_text': {'text': 'VOLUME'}}, {'go_back': {}}, {'click_element': {'index': 29}}, {'scroll_to_text': {'text': 'MARKET_CAP'}}, {'scroll_to_text': {'text': 'VOLUME'}}, {'extract_content': {'include_links': False}}, {'done': {'text': '{"stock_price": "$222.83", "price_change": "-$0.83", "company_name": "Apple Inc", "market_cap": "3.36T USD", "volume": "51.42M", "news_items": ["As Apple Earnings Near, More Investors Think the iPhone Maker‚Äôs Stock Is Primed to Fall", "Is Apple Stock a Buy Before Q1 Earnings?", "Apple\'s Earnings Strength Keeps BofA Bullish Despite iPhone Concerns", "Nvidia overtakes Apple by market value"], "search_input": ""}'}}])
